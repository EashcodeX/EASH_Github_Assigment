“Fun Facts About Me 😂”
	•	Since my college is far from home, I’ve been forced to become my own chef 🍳. Let’s just say my cooking skills are… still under development (just like half the code I write)! 😂
	•	I write with my left hand ✍️, but somehow manage to create chaos with both hands equally. True talent, right? 😆
	•	Sleep is a luxury I can’t afford—I survive on 4 hours of sleep, Wi-Fi signals, and pure determination! 💻⚡
	•	My brain has two modes: Ultra Focus Mode when working and Error 404 Mode when asked a simple question before coffee. ☕🤣
	•	If multitasking was an Olympic sport, I’d at least qualify for the finals—coding, troubleshooting, cooking, and forgetting where I kept my phone, all at the same time! 😅
