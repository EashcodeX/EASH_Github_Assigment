I am R. Eashwara Prasadh, currently pursuing my 2nd year in Computer and Communication Engineering (CCE). 
I am from Karaikal and have taken a room near my college to focus on my studies and projects.
I have a strong foundation in front-end development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
along with back-end development in Java.
My expertise extends to cybersecurity (intermediate level),
IT support (including Outlook troubleshooting 
and Server 2019/2022), and Office 365 (master level). 
Additionally, I have experience working with ticketing systems like ServiceNow (basic level)
